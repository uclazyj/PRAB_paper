@article{QuickPIC2006,
	Abstract = {A highly efficient, fully parallelized, fully relativistic, three-dimensional particle-in-cell model for simulating plasma and laser wakefield acceleration is described. The model is based on the quasi-static or frozen field approximation, which reduces a fully three-dimensional electromagnetic field solve and particle push to a two-dimensional field solve and particle push. This is done by calculating the plasma wake assuming that the drive beam and/or laser does not evolve during the time it takes for it to pass a plasma particle. The complete electromagnetic fields of the plasma wake and its associated index of refraction are then used to evolve the drive beam and/or laser using very large time steps. This algorithm reduces the computational time by 2--3 orders of magnitude. Comparison between the new algorithm and conventional fully explicit models (OSIRIS) is presented. The agreement is excellent for problems of interest. Direction for future work is also presented.},

@article{QuickPIC2013,
	Abstract = {We present improvements to the three-dimensional (3D) quasi-static particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm, which is used to efficiently model short-pulse laser and particle beam--plasma interactions. In this algorithm the fields including the index of refraction created by a static particle/laser beam are calculated. These fields are then used to advance the particle/laser beam forward in time (distance). For a 3D quasi-static code, calculating the wake fields is done using a two-dimensional (2D) PIC code where the time variable is ξ=ct-z and z is the propagation direction of the particle/laser beam. When calculating the wake, the fields, particle positions and momenta are not naturally time centered so an iterative predictor corrector loop is required. In the previous iterative loop in QuickPIC (currently the only 3D quasi-static PIC code), the field equations are derived using the Lorentz gauge. Here we describe a new algorithm which uses gauge independent field equations. It is found that with this new algorithm, the results converge to the results from fully explicitly PIC codes with far fewer iterations (typically 1 iteration as compared to 2--8) for a wide range of problems. In addition, we describe a new deposition scheme for directly depositing the time derivative of the current that is needed in one of the field equations. The new deposition scheme does not require message passing for the particles inside the iteration loop, which greatly improves the speed for parallelized calculations. Comparisons of results from the new and old algorithms and to fully explicit PIC codes are also presented.},

	Abstract = {This article introduces an analytical formalism for the calculation of the evolution of beam moments and the transverse emittance for beams which are externally injected into plasma wakefield accelerators. This formalism is then applied to two scenarios with increasing complexity --- a single beam slice without energy gain and a single beam slice with energy gain, both propagating at a fixed co-moving position behind the driver. The obtained results are then compared to particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations as well as results obtained using an semi-analytic numerical approach (SANA) (Mehrling et al., 2016). We find excellent agreement between results from the analytical model and from SANA and PIC.},

@article{PWFA_FACETII,
	Abstract = {During the past two decades of research, the ultra-relativistic beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) concept has achieved many significant milestones. These include the demonstration of ultra-high gradient acceleration of electrons over meter-scale plasma accelerator structures, efficient acceleration of a narrow energy spread electron bunch at high-gradients, positron acceleration using wakes in uniform plasmas and in hollow plasma channels, and demonstrating that highly nonlinear wakes in the `blow-out regime' have the electric field structure necessary for preserving the emittance of the accelerating bunch. A new 10 GeV electron beam facility, Facilities for Accelerator Science and Experimental Test (FACET) II, is currently under construction at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for the next generation of PWFA research and development. The FACET II beams will enable the simultaneous demonstration of substantial energy gain of a small emittance electron bunch while demonstrating an efficient transfer of energy from the drive to the trailing bunch. In this paper we first describe the capabilities of the FACET II facility. We then describe a series of PWFA experiments supported by numerical and particle-in-cell simulations designed to demonstrate plasma wake generation where the drive beam is nearly depleted of its energy, high efficiency acceleration of the trailing bunch while doubling its energy and ultimately, quantifying the emittance growth in a single stage of a PWFA that has optimally designed matching sections. We then briefly discuss other FACET II plasma-based experiments including in situ positron generation and acceleration, and several schemes that are promising for generating sub-micron emittance bunches that will ultimately be needed for both an early application of a PWFA and for a plasma-based future linear collider.},
